## Usage

Basic syntax:

```
cpdirmk [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY
```

## Options

- `-h, --help`: Display the help message and exit
- `-v, --version`: Show the program version and exit
- `-o, --output=FILE`: Specify the output file (default: output.md)
- `-d, --depth=NUMBER`: Set the maximum depth for directory traversal
- `-i, --ignore=PATTERN`: Ignore files/directories matching the specified pattern

## Examples

1. Generate a Markdown representation of the current directory:
   ```
   cpdirmk .
   ```

2. Create a structure of a specific directory with a custom output file:
   ```
   cpdirmk -o project_structure.md /path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Limit the depth and ignore certain files/directories:
   ```
   cpdirmk -d 3 -i '*.tmp' -i 'node_modules' -o limited_structure.md /path/to/project
   ```

## File Type Handling

`cpdirmk` intelligently handles various file types:

- **Text Files**: Content is included in the Markdown output.
- **Binary Files**: Marked as binary without content display.
- **Special Files**: Identified and handled appropriately (e.g., executables, symlinks).
- **Large Files**: Size is displayed instead of content for files exceeding a certain threshold.
